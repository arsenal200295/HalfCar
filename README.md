Project: HalfCar

The very first thing to do is open the "HalfCar.prj" project which can be seen in the left side of the Matlab window in the "Current Folder" area.

IMPORTANT - Please wait until the variable "hcar" appears in the "Workspace" (on the right side of the Matlab window). 

IMPORTANT - Please do not access the files from the "Curruent Folder" in the left. It has a lot of files which have been excluded from the project. 
Please use the "Prject - HalfCar" TAB in the top of this window to access files and folders.

Remanining instructions can be found in the file "1_Helpfile.mlx". To access it, navigate to "READ ME" ---> "1_Helpfile.mlx".

For a quick run, nagivate to "FOR USER - SCRIPTS - UI" ---> "Run" ---> "RunSim.mlx" and press the green Run button on the top portion of the Matlab window.


**NOTE - Throughout the Model the suffix "1" refers to the front end of the car and "2" refers to the rear end of the car
