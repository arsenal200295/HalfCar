Project: HalfCar
The very first thing to do is open the "HalfCar.prj" project which can be seen in the left side of the Matlab window in the "Current Folder" area.
IMPORTANT - Please wait until the variable "hcar" appears in the "Workspace" (on the right side of the Matlab window). 
Remanining instructions can be found in the file "1_Helpfile.mlx". To access it, navigate to "READ ME" ---> "1_Helpfile.mlx".
For a quick run, nagivate to "FOR USER - SCRIPTS - UI" ---> "Run" ---> "RunSim.mlx" and press the green Run button on the top portion of the Matlab window.
